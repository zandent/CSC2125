\section{What would happen if a powerful attacker identifies all participants of one shard
in OmniLedger and launches DDoS attacks to take down the participants of the
shard (make them offline)? Will this attack affect transactions in other shards?}

\section{What would happen if the attacker is able to even bribe the participants to
process invalid transactions? Will this attack affect transactions in other shards?}

\section{Is Monoxide running 64 parallel Nakamoto consensus chains (without Chukonu
mining) less secure than the original Bitcoin consensus? Why?}

\section{Suppose a Monoxide node is using Chukonu mining on k shards. How many
resources (e.g., storage, computation, etc.) the node would need comparing to a
node without Chukonu mining? Is sharding really useful in this Chukonu mining
case?}
